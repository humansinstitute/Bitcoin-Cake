# Bitcoin Layered - Reference Architecture

This Project has been started to collaborate on an Open reference architecture to support development of a money over IP stack, specifically with reference to the Bitcoin Ecosystem.

As a community we often talk about how bitcoin will scale in layers, however it can be difficult to understand what all these different layers might be, what the purpose of each layer would be and how properties would emerge across this layered stack.

Hoping to contribute in this area this open source projecthas been created to collaborate on a reference model for a future state Money over IP (MOIP) stack based.

The purpose of this project is to:

	* Build a shared view of a layered architecture for MoIP systems. 
	* Provide an educational resource to explain different layers of the stack.
	* Provide a mental model to evaluate current technologies and proposals and where they may fit. 
	* Teach me how to better engage in open source :)

A base architecture pattern is presented in [architecture folder](https://github.com/karma-pete/Bitcoin-Layers-Reference-Architecture/tree/master/Architecture).  Updates to this will be managed through git.  This pattern will then be applied to range of scenarios and discussion in the [Scenarios Folder](https://github.com/karma-pete/Bitcoin-Layers-Reference-Architecture/tree/master/Scenarios).

For more information feel free to get involved or reach out [@Pete_Winn on Twitter](https://twitter.com/Pete_Winn).

The following values are proposed as a framework to manage this project:

	* Community: We will seek to build a supportive and open community. 
	* Freedom: We believe in freedom of expression, contribution and freedom to reuse this work.
	* Pragmatism: We will seek creative, simple and realistic solutions, bound by constraints.
	* Educate: We will openly support others in developing better education in the larger community.
